## Features

* **GUI:** mainly use QGraphicsview.
* **Databese:** connect to local sqlite database.
* **Cheat:** you can choose cheat option in the "cheat!" menu and do whatever you want. XD
    (GodMode => fight with monster do not decrease your HP but increase it!)
* **Gender:** different gender has different basic stats.
* **Shop:** you can buy something like hp, attack, different keys here.
* **Book:** you can look up it and know monster more in this floor, "expected damage" is very helpful.
* **Miss + Crit:** there will be some random miss or critical damage during fight, so there is no absolute best result.
* **BGM:** use qmediaplayer (not completely finished, so I just use a example BGM).
* **NPC:** they will give you some advices.
* **Level up:** kill enough monsters and you will level up, so be brave!
* **Help:** after start game, you can press "h" key for help.
* **Different endings:** there are three differnt endings, wish you find a nice one :)

### REMEMER! You task is to **save the pricess in the top of the tower.**

## Time

* This game may need 2-3 hours to finish (without cheat!), enjoy it in your free time~ (In the future, floors will increase to 20 or more, so it will be more fun.)
