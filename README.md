Here are several main step to run the game:

1. Download [Qt creator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-6)
2. Open the MagicTower.pro
3. Use the default configure option, after open it, right click the project "MagicTower" choose "qmake", then again choose "build"
4. **Do not run** (if run you will see a white screen with nothing), you should **copy all the files in "file" directory** into the place where you build it
	(Windows: In my computer is "{where you put your project}\build-MagicTower-Desktop_Qt_5_3_MSVC2012_OpenGL_32bit-Debug")
	(Ubuntu: In my computer is "{where you put your project}\build-MagicTower-Desktop-Debug")
	(Mac: In your MagicTower.app folder)
5. Run it and enjoy it~

#### Ps:	
   1. **In windows**, maybe happen some QMYSQL error, then you should:
	copy the two .dll file in "mysql" directory into "{where you install your Qt}\5.3\msvc2012_opengl\bin" and then rebuild.
      
      **In ubuntu** , just run "sudo apt-get install libqt5sql5-mysql" and then rebuild.
	
   2. If you meet "Unknown module(s) in QT: multimedia" error in ubuntu, just run "sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev" and then rebuild
   3. During save and load, it will need a little bit of time, so please wait 1-2 seconds.
